            <p>The term "cake" has a long history. The word itself is of <i>Viking</i> origin, from the Old Norse word
                <i>"kaka"</i> .
            </p>

            <p>The ancient Greeks called cake <i>πλακοῦς (plakous)</i> , which was derived from the word for "flat",
                <i>πλακόεις (plakoeis)</i> . It was baked using flour mixed with eggs, milk, nuts, and honey. They also
                had
                a cake called <i>satura</i> , which was a flat heavy cake. During the Roman period, the name for cake
                became
                <i>placenta</i> which was derived from the Greek term. A placenta was baked on a pastry base or inside a
                pastry case.
            </p>

            <p>The Greeks invented beer as a leavener, frying fritters in olive oil, and cheesecakes using goat's milk.
                In
                ancient Rome, the basic bread dough was sometimes enriched with butter, eggs, and honey, which produced
                a
                sweet and cake-like baked good. Latin poet Ovid refers to his and his brother's birthday party and cake
                in
                his first book of exile, Tristia.</p>

            <p>Early cakes in England were also essentially bread: the most obvious differences between a "cake" and
                "bread"
                were the round, flat shape of the cakes, and the cooking method, which turned cakes over once while
                cooking,
                while bread was left upright throughout the baking process.</p>

            <p>Sponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the <i>Renaissance</i>, possibly in Spain.</p>
