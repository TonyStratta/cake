            <h1>Varieties</h1>

            <p>Cakes are broadly divided into several categories, based primarily on ingredients and mixing techniques.
                Although clear examples of the difference between cake and bread are easy to find, the precise
                classification has always been elusive.</p>

                <dt>Butter cake</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Butter cakes are made from creamed butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They rely on the combination
                        of
                        butter and sugar beaten for an extended time to incorporate air into the batter. <em>A classic
                            pound
                            cake is made with a pound each of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour.</em> Another type of
                        butter
                        cake that takes its names from the proportion of ingredients used is 1-2-3-4 cake: 1 cup butter,
                        2
                        cups sugar, 3 cups flour, and 4 eggs. According to Beth Tartan, this cake was one of the most
                        common
                        among the American pioneers who settled North Carolina.</p>

                    <p>Baking powder is in many butter cakes, such as <i>Victoria</i> sponge. The ingredients are
                        sometimes
                        mixed without creaming the butter, using recipes for simple and quick cakes</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Sponge cake</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p> <em>Sponge cakes (or foam cakes) are made from whipped eggs, sugar, and flour</em>. Traditional
                        sponge cakes are leavened only with eggs. They rely primarily on trapped air in a protein matrix
                        (generally of beaten eggs) to provide leavening, sometimes with a bit of baking powder or other
                        chemical leaven added. Egg-leavened sponge cakes are thought to be the oldest cakes made without
                        yeast.</p>

                    <p>Angel food cake is a white cake that uses only the whites of the eggs and is traditionally baked
                        in a
                        tube pan. The French Génoise is a sponge cake that includes clarified butter. Highly decorated
                        sponge cakes with lavish toppings are sometimes called gateau, the French word for cake. Chiffon
                        cakes are sponge cakes with vegetable oil, which adds moistness.</p>

                <dt>Chocolate cake</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Chocolate cakes are butter cakes, sponge cakes, or other cakes flavored with melted chocolate or
                        cocoa powder. German chocolate cake is a variety of chocolate cake. Fudge cakes are chocolate
                        cakes
                        that contain fudge.</p>
                </dd>


                <dt>Coffee cake</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Coffee cake is generally thought of as a cake to serve with coffee or tea at breakfast or a
                        coffee
                        break. Some types use yeast as a leavening agent while others use baking soda or baking powder.
                        These cakes often have a crumb topping called streusel or a light glaze drizzle.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>Flourless cake</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Baked flourless cakes include baked cheesecakes and flourless chocolate cakes. Cheesecakes,
                        despite
                        their name, are not cakes at all. Cheesecakes are custard pies, with a filling made mostly of
                        some
                        form of cheese (often cream cheese, mascarpone, ricotta, or the like), and have very little
                        flour
                        added, although a flour-based or graham cracker crust may be used. Cheesecakes are also very
                        old,
                        with evidence of honey-sweetened cakes dating back to ancient Greece.</p>

                <dt>Layer cakes</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>Layer cakes are cakes made with layers of sponge or butter cake, filled with cream, jam or other
                        filling to hold the layers together.</p>
                </dd>

                <dt>One egg cake</dt>
                <dd>
                    <p>One egg cakes are made with one egg. They can be made with butter or vegetable shortening. One
                        egg
                        cake was an economical recipe when using two eggs for each cake was too costly.</p>
